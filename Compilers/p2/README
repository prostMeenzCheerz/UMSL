This project builds on p1, by replacing "testScanner" with another driver program that will attempt to build a parse tree from a 
given BNF.

All of the same token instance information is stored in a parse tree node.

If an error is found while building a token, it will exit with proper dialogue to pinpoint the reason for the error, and its location in
the file.

Once the EOF token has been reached, the tree is printed out using post-order traversal.
