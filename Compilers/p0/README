The intent of this program is to create a parse tree from words read either from an input file, or from input typed on the command line.
When a word is read, a node is made containing a "key" which is the first letter of that word.
The word itself is then stored in a container inside that node.
If another word is read with the same first letter, that word will be placed in the node containing its "key".  
The words are stored alphabetically.
If a word is already stored in the tree, it will not be stored another time.
Once the end of the file is reached, the tree is printed out using: in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal.
