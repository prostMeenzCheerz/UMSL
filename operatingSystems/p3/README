THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS, AND SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR PROCESSES RUNNING, AND MEMORY THAT ISN'T CLEARED UP.

-To handle concurrency I used semaphores instead of message queues.

-My approach was to create an array of 18 structs that would be given out to each user process.  
  Aside from the struct members used to keep track of time, I created other members to be used as flag variables in an attempt to 
  corral the actions of the oss and user processes.

-The file used to hold data output by the oss is log.txt.  
  I took advantage of the freopen function so every time the program was run, the file pointer would be writting to a blank file.  
  This was just to save you a step from having to run make clean if you wanted to run the program several times.

-You will have to run make for your initial run of the program.  ./oss from the command line to run.
