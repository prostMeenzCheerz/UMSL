For this project, I decided to use an unamed SysV semaphore, because I was unable to get the named POSIX semaphore to work properly.

I tried my best to modularize my code, so all of the function definitions are below main.

I have also tried my best to comment out the code as much as possible to explain the logic.


To run:

start by running 'make'

call with -s for number of processes to have running at one time

use -l to choose the name of your logfile, otherwise it is defaulted to log.txt (make clean will remove that file)

use -t to change the time on for the alarm on the signal handler to terminate the program

(TO RUN A SECOND TIME, TYPE: 'make clean')
