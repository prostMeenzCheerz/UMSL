This program is designed to mimic how operating systems schedule jobs based on resource allocation.

It uses the bankers alogorithm to determine whether or not an incoming job should be granted its resources based on the amount of 
resources available, the amount of resources that are already allocated, and what jobs are blocked based on resources needed.

to run the program, type ./oss

for verbose on, use the getopt -v then type "on"
otherwise verbose is automatically set to off

the project will clean up nicely, but my log.txt file will be nowhere near 100000 lines

also, i keep track of how long processes were blocked in my log file
