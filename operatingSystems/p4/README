This program is designed to mimic how operating systems schedule jobs based on resource allocation.

It uses 

to run the program, type ./oss

for verbose on, use the getopt -v then type "on"
otherwise verbose is automatically set to off

the project will clean up nicely, but my log.txt file will be nowhere near 100000 lines

also, i keep track of how long processes were blocked in my log file
